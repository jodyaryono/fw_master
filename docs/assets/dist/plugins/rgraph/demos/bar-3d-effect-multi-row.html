    <h1>A 3D Bar chart with multiple rows</h1>

    <canvas id="cvs" width="650" height="300" style="float: right">[No canvas support]</canvas>

    <p>
        This style of 3D chart is not supported natively but is pretty easy to
        achieve - especially as all of the source code is shown below and you can just
        copy it!
    </p>
    
    <p>
        First some variables are defined which are used in the configuration - this is so that they're
        easier for you to edit and manage.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Each row of bars is actually a separate chart object and they're drawn inside a dedicated function.
        The 3D variant options turn off the 3D axes and the regular axes are also turned off. Slight shadows
        are set which add to the 3D effect.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The background grid is turned off for the second and third charts but is enabled for the first - the
        chart at the back.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The margins are set to those defined in the variables along with the Y axis scale max value. The Y
        axis labels are turned off.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Finally a drawing API Y axis object is used to draw a Y axis on the right-hand-side. The color of
        this Y axis is transparent so the only part of it that you can see is the labels.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The second and third Bar charts are drawn when they're triggered by the previous charts animation
        callback function (ie the second function is called by the first <code>grow()</code> animations
        callback and the third function is called by the second <code>grow()</code> animations callback).
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Like the code for the rest of this chart, the responsive section is not inconsiderable. It
        reduces the size of the canvas, changes the X axis labels to the three-letter variations of
        the weekday names, changes the margin sizes on all three objects and changes the
        <code>textSize</code> on the main Bar chart and the Y axis object.
    </p>

    <script>
        // Some default variables. These margins are not all hard-and-fast
        // values - some are increased and some are reduced for each chart.
        marginLeft    = 60;
        marginRight   = 25;
        marginTop     = 45;

        marginInner   = 20;
        
        // This is the same for each chart
        yaxisScaleMax = 35;

        // How many animation frames there are
        frames        = 20;
        
        // Used later
