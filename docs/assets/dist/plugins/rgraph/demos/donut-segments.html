    <h1>A segmented Donut chart</h1>
    
    <canvas id="cvs" width="350" height="350" style="background-color: black; float: right">[No canvas support]</canvas>
    
    <p>
        This is an example of using the Pie chart that's customised to such a degree
        that it appears as more like a progress meter or a "percent complete" style meter.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The segmentation effect is achieved by using the <code>draw</code> event. This
        event is used by code that draws lines from outside the Donut chart back to
        the center, drawing them every 10-15 degrees. In this custom code the RGraph
        API function <code>RGraph.degrees2Radians()</code> is used to do the necessary conversion
        and the <code>RGraph.path2()</code> function is used to handle the pathing of these lines.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The text in the center of the Donut chart is added by using the RGraph
        drawing API - the <code>Text</code> object. On each frame of the
        <code>roundRobin()</code> effect the object is updated with the new percentage and it then
        gets redrawn. This gives you an effect of the text constantly changing.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The chart is quite small and fits well on smaller devices so it doesn't need a lot changing
        with the <code>responsive()</code> function. The only thing that's done is the CSS
        <code>float</code> of the canvas tag is removed.
    </p>

    This goes in the documents header:
    <pre class="code">
&lt;script src="RGraph.common.core.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="RGraph.drawing.text.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="RGraph.pie.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
    
    Put this where you want the chart to show up:
    <pre class="code">
&lt;canvas id="cvs" width="350" height="350"&gt;
    [No canvas support]
&lt;/canvas&gt;
</pre>

    This is the code that generates the chart:
    <div id="dynamic-source-code"></div>
    <script>showSource()</script>
    
</body>
